Growing up, I always took an interest in science, problem solving, and building things. I spent countless hours during my childhood reading books about topics ranging from volcanos to space travel, building cities out of Legos, and exploring the natural environment of Southern California. I also enjoyed cracking real-world puzzles, winning first place in the "Problem Solving" category three years in a row during a mathematics competition at my elementary school. This would turn out to be an omen as I took to computer programming almost immediately while taking a Web design class in high school. I quickly realized while taking this class that software engineering was what I wanted to do and began teaching myself everything I could about computers and giving myself new challenges to conquer with the help of mentors I met along the way.

Now, I continue my lifelong habit of learning everything I can while seeking opportunities to apply my skills to meaningful causes.

Software Development
======
Beginning with the Web design class I took as a sophomore in high school, my software development career began with programming the backends of websites in PHP. This soon expanded into creating interactive Web applications using MySQL databases and JavaScript on the frontend. I began applying the skills I had acquired thus far by working on websites and software tools for local businesses. After getting hired at the AVID Center as an intern during my senior year to work on ticket management, I quickly began working closely with the Data and Analysis and Creative Solutions departments developing internal software tools and working on their company website, primarily by performing quality assurance (QA) testing. Here, I got my first experience developing in C# and gained more skill with frontend JavaScript. I worked at AVID Center for approximately 7 months before I enlisted in the United States Air Force.

While enlisted in the Air Force, I continued developing myself as a software engineer. I worked on several projects for a variety of customers, including the Army, Air Force, and several private organizations affiliated with the military. Through these projects, I gained hands-on experience developing multiple organizational websites using HTML/CSS, as well as CMS's like SharePoint and Wix, mods in C# for virtual reality video games developed for the Unity game engine, and full-stack Web applications developed in JavaScript using Express.js, PostgreSQL, and Bootstrap. I also got my first experiences programming in C++ and Python. Needless to say, working on these projects did much to continue my development as a programmer.

Leadership
======
During my time stationed at Fort Gordon, I founded and led a non-profit organization of computer programmers and software developers called "Falcon Coders". This organization provides mentoring for both new and experienced programmers and provides software consultancy and development services to other non-profit organizations. This required me to manage several projects concurrently at any given time, ensuring that customer needs were being met while also making sure that our programmers were gaining valuable experience.
